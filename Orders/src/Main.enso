   # Combining Spreadsheet Data in Enso
   
   ## Overview
   
   You have an Excel file that has 3 tabs (pictured below)
   
   1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer data, with a Customer ID which is a unique key, and has data that contains the customer's name and phone number.
   
   2Ô∏è‚É£ Item data, with an Item ID which is a unique key, and has each item's category and price.
   
   3Ô∏è‚É£ Order data, which  has an Order ID which is a unique key, along with the Customer ID and Item ID for that order, along with their quanity ordered.
   
   .
   
   ### **Using this data, you are tasked with calculating the total order value for each customer, and put them in order of largest to smallest customer based on this total order value.**
   
   **.**
   
   ### Here are the steps we took to solve this problem
   
   1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Excel file. Here, the file is embedded into this project. Typically, you would drag the file onto the canvas (the background) from your computer to add the file to the project, or click where you see the word 'path' shown in the ***Data.read*** component to bring up a file browser.
   
   2Ô∏è‚É£ Read in the "Orders" sheet from the Excel file that we have chosen.
   
   3Ô∏è‚É£ Read in the "Items" sheet from the Excel file that we have chosen.
   
   4Ô∏è‚É£ Join the "Orders" and "Items" sheets together, using the [Item ID] as the key to tie the two sheets together. For Excel power-users, you may have used vlookup or xlookup functions to do this before.
   
   5Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new column, called [Order Value], and fill it with [Unit Price] * [Quantity].
   
   6Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregate the data, grouping by the [Customer ID] and adding up for each [Customer ID] their total amount spent. We create a new column called [Orders Value] with this value.
   
   7Ô∏è‚É£ Read in the "Customers" sheet from the Excel file that we have chosen.
   
   8Ô∏è‚É£ Join the "Customers" sheet with the aggregated [Orders Value] by [Customer ID] output data, to add the [Customer Name] and [Phone Number] to the aggregated [Orders Value].
   
   9Ô∏è‚É£ Sort the joined data by the Orders Value, from largest to smallest.
   
   üîü Round the data to 2 decimal places. We now have our customers ranked from top to bottom for their overall order value.
   
   .
   
   ### **We have expanded the data visualization to show the table on each step You can close these visualizations by clicking on the eye at the top of each visualization.**

main =
    ## 1 - Typically you would drag this file onto the canvas. If you click on the word "path" here, you will also see how you can select a file from your computer.
    any1 = Data.read enso_project.data/'store_data.xlsx'
    ## 7 - Read the customers table.
    operator3 = any1.read 'Customers'
    ## 3 - Read the products table.
    operator4 = any1.read 'Items'
    ## 2 - Read the orders history.
    operator5 = any1.read 'Orders'
    ## 4 - Join the item data to the order history, to get information on item prices in the orders table.
    operator8 = operator5.join operator4  ..Inner [..Equals 'Item ID']
    ## 5 - Create a new column and calculate the Order Value for each order.
    operator10 = operator8.set (..Simple_Expr (..Name 'Unit Price') (..Multiply (..Name 'Quantity'))) 'Order Value'
    ## 6 - Group all orders by the Customer ID, to compute the total value of orders placed by each client.
    operator11 = operator10.aggregate ['Customer ID'] [..Sum 'Order Value' 'Orders Value']
    ## 8 - Join the customer data into orders table, to include names in the final ranking.
    operator16 = operator3.join operator11 ..Inner [(..Equals 'Customer ID')]
    ## 9 - Sort the customers by their lifetime value, with the most valuable customers at the start of the table.
    operator17 = operator16.sort [(..Name 'Orders Value' ..Descending)]
    ## 10 - Round the Orders Value to 2 decimal places.
    operator12 = operator17.set (..Simple_Expr (..Name 'Orders Value') (..Round 2)) 'Orders Value'
